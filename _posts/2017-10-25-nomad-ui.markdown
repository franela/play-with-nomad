The Nomad UI offers an easy to use web experience for inspecting a Nomad cluster.
Jobs, Deployments, Task Groups, Allocations, Clients, and Servers can all be
monitored from the Nomad UI. The UI also supports the use of ACL tokens for
clusters that are using the Nomad Access Control List system.

```
~> **Beta Feature!** This page covers the Nomad UI, a feature of v0.7 which is still in beta.
```

## Accessing the UI

First, let's start nomad so it listens on all interfaces. You can run the following command for that:

```.term1
nomad agent -dev -bind 0.0.0.0 &> nomad.log &
```

The Nomad UI is served on the same address and port as the HTTP API. It is namespaced
under `/ui`, but visiting the root of the Nomad server in your browser will redirect you
to the UI. If you are unsure what port the Nomad HTTP API is running under, try the default
port, `4646`.h


### You can access the ui by clicking [here](/ui/){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="4646"}

## Reviewing Jobs

The home page of the UI is the jobs list view. This page has a searchable, sortable,
paginated table of all jobs in the cluster, regardless of job status.

[![Jobs List][img-jobs-list]](/ui/jobs/){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="4646"}


To sort the table, click a table column's header cell. To search, type a query into the searchbox.
By default the search will fuzzy-match any job name, but by starting a query with a `/`, the search
will instead be based on a regular expression.

Sort property, sort direction, search term, and page number are all stored as query params to make
sharing links easier.

In addition to name, each job in the table includes details such as current status, type, priority,
number of task groups, and an aggregation of all allocations by allocation status.

[![Job Row Detail][img-jobs-row-detail]][img-jobs-row-detail]{:target="_blank"}

## Inspecting a Job

Clicking on a job will navigate to the Job Detail page. This page shows a list of task groups
for the job as well as the status of each allocation for each task group by allocation status.

Let's create our job and see how we can use the Nomad UI to inspect it.

```.term1
nomad init
nomad run example.nomad
```

Now that our job has been created, click in the image below to see the details.

[![Job Detail][img-job-detail]](/ui/jobs/example){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="4646"}



### Reading a Job Definition

The Job Detail page has multiple tabs, one of which is Definition. On the Definition page, the full
job definition is shown as an interactive JSON object.

[![Job Definition][img-job-definition]](/ui/jobs/example/definition){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="4646"}

### Reviewing Past Job Versions

Job Versions can be found on the Versions tab on the Job Detail page. This page has a timeline view of
every tracked version for the job.

[![Job Versions][img-job-versions]](/ui/jobs/example/versions){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="4646"}

Each version can be toggled to also show the diff between job versions.

[![Job Version Diff][img-job-version-diff]][img-job-version-diff]{:target="_blank"}

### Reviewing Past Job Deployments

Job Deployments are listed on the Deployments tab on the Job Detail page. Every tracked deployment is listed in
a timeline view.

[![Job Deployments][img-job-deployments]](/ui/jobs/example/deployments){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="4646"}

Each deployment can be toggle to show information about the deployment, including canaries placed and desired,
allocations placed and desired, healthy and unhealthy allocations, task group metrics, and existing allocations.

[![Job Deployment Detail][img-job-deployment-detail]][img-job-deployment-detail]{:target="_blank"}

### Monitoring a Current Job Deployment

When a deployment is currently running, it is called out on the Job Detail Overview tab.

[![Active Job Deployment][img-active-job-deployment]][img-active-job-deployment]{:target="_blank"}

## Inspecting a Task Group

Clicking on a task group from the Job Detail page will navigate to the Task Group Detail page. This page shows
the aggregated resource metrics for a task group as well as a list of all associated allocations.

[![Task Group Detail][img-task-group-detail]][img-task-group-detail]{:target="_blank"}

## Inspecting an Allocation

From the Task Group Detail page, each allocation in the allocations table will report basic information about
the allocation, including utilized CPU and memory.

[![Allocation Stats][img-allocation-stats]][img-allocation-stats]{:target="_blank"}

```
~> **Note.** To collect current CPU and memory statistics, the Nomad UI makes requests directly to the client
~> the allocation is running on. These requests will fail unless the browser session is running in the same
~> subnet as the Nomad client.
```

Clicking an allocation will navigate to the Allocation Detail page. From here, the event history for each task
in the allocation can be seen.

[![Allocation Detail][img-allocation-detail]][img-allocation-detail]{:target="_blank"}

## Reviewing Clients

Clicking the Clients link in the left-hand menu of the Nomad UI will navigate to the Clients List page. This page
has a searchable, sortable, paginated table of all clients in the cluster.

Sort property, sort direction, search term, and page number are all stored as query params to make
sharing links easier.

In addition to name, each client in the table includes details such as current status, address, datacenter,
and number of allocations.

[![Clients List][img-clients-list]](/ui/nodes){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="4646"}

## Inspecting a Client

Clicking on a client will navigate to the Client Detail page. This page shows the status of the client as
well as the list of all allocations placed on the client. Additionally, all attributes of the machine are
itemized.

[![Client Detail][img-client-detail]][img-client-detail]{:target="_blank"}

## Inspecting Servers

Clicking on the Servers link in the left-hand menu of the Nomad UI will navigate to the Servers List page. This
page lists all servers, including which one is the current leader.

Clicking on a server in the list will open up a table that lists the Tags for the server.

[![Server Detail][img-server-detail]](/ui/servers){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="4646"}

## Using an ACL Token

When the Nomad ACL system is enabled for the cluster, tokens can be used to gain elevated permissions to see
otherwise private jobs, nodes, and other details. To register a token with the UI, click ACL Tokens on the
right-hand side of the top navigation.

The ACL Tokens page has a two field form for providing a token Secret ID and token Accessor ID. The form
automatically updates as the values change, and once a Secret ID is provided, all future HTTP requests the
Nomad UI makes will provide the Secret ID as the ACL Token via the `X-Nomad-Token` request header.

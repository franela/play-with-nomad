## About play-with-nomad

Play-with-nomad (PWN) is a site made by Docker captains [Marcos Nils](https://www.twitter.com/marcosnils) and [Jonathan Leibiusky](https://www.twitter.com/xetorthio). PWN is a Nomad playground which allows you to try Nomad either stand alone or clustering in a matter of seconds. It gives you the experience of having a free Alpine Linux Virtual Machine in the cloud where you can build and run Nomad jobs and even create cluster. Under the hood DIND or Docker-in-Docker is used to give the effect of multiple VMs/PCs.
